# API
Using Node.js and MongoDB to get API connected and display data.
Code Challenge

This is coding exercise used by Shipt for technical recruitment purposes.

Getting Started

create a very basic API application, where a customer can have an order that is made up of products.

Prerequisites

node.js, express.js, mongodb, and sublime using cmd

Installing

1. Using cmd to install moongoose allow you to write model schema, and create router under express.js to set up API. 
2. created some made up products for query use.
3. server.js is the file being run which contain all the Dependencies, View Engine, MongoDB connection, and Router.

Link for Testing
http://127.0.0.1:3000/
http://127.0.0.1:3000/date
http://127.0.0.1:3000/customer
I have added my ip adress to replace localhost for testing on my local

Accomplish with More Time
If I have more time to finish the designing API, I will have spend more time making data and testing by customer inserting more user input and get req.body to show the result in other response page.
